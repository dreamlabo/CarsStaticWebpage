It was so exciting to have come across this groove. Polly had given me a beautiful poem for our wedding anniversary, which was sitting on the desk right next to me, so I picked it up and sang it on the track, to hear what it would sound like with words. I played it to Polly, and she said, 'Lovely, great, I'll need fiddle with it a bit. So she added a couple of verses, and there it was - very serendipitous.'",
