                            <p>
                                The Colorado Art Rock Society was founded 
                                on March 12, 1999 by Phil Satterley and Alan Mallery. While waiting 
                                in line to see a Yes concert, Alan noticed Phil leafing through a 
                                copy of Paramhansa Yoganada's Autobiography of a Yogi. Phil was 
                                caught up in a footnote on page 92 that described a secret society 
                                of music lovers who only listen to music in odd meters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the show, Alan followed Phil back 
                                to his house where the two of them began holding sessions by 
                                candlelight. The concept came together during one 6-hour session 
                                which carried on until 7a.m. They had listened to Van Der Graaf 
                                Generator's entire back catalog. It was a magical experience that 
                                left both of them exhilarated for days. They both agreed that 
                                there was only one course of action and that was to form a music
                                society for like minded and intelligent odd-metered music 
                                connoisseurs, The Colorado Art Rock Society.

                            <h3>The Real Story</h3>
                            <h4>A Note From Phil...</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Colorado Art Rock Society (C.A.R.S.) 
                                was formed in 1999 when Phil Satterley had a chance meeting with 
                                Alan and Carrie Mallery at the Bajaprog '99 Festival in Mexicali, 
                                Mexico (surprisingly the first people Phil even talked to after 
                                arriving in Mexico were also from Colorado!) The first meeting 
                                was on March 27,1999 when C.A.R.S. met at the Margarita Bay Club 
                                in Denver Colorado. With just 4 members at that meeting C.A.R.S. 
                                was born. Suddenly the numbers grew and after reaching over 15, 
                                C.A.R.S. moved out of the smaller back meeting room and was 
                                forced to take over the entire upstairs until December 29, 2001 
                                when the club closed and the group moved to it's second location 
                                at the Morrison Inn in Golden Colorado (actually just down the 
                                street from the famed Red Rocks Amphitheater).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The group met there as the numbers 
                                grew and so did the noise level! The tiled floors and high 
                                ceilings made it quite difficult to hear the music, let alone 
                                hear each other! Finally it was decided to move. Our next 
                                location was the Yummy Yummy Thai restaurant on October 25, 2003 
                                and the C.A.R.S. holiday party on December 13th. It was decided 
                                once again to move because of space issues and belly dancers?!?!?! 
                                and it was off to the Breckenridge Brew Pub (right next to the 
                                famed Coors Baseball field in Denver) where we are now. The 
                                space is the right size, it's a closed off meeting area as well 
                                as being perfect for listening to music as well as setting up 
                                a wide screen projector for watching Prog videos!

                            <p>
                                The last Saturday evening of each month is spent eating, drinking, 
                                making new friends as well as indulging in heavy doses of 
                                Progressive Rock conversations, listening and CD swapping. 
                                Membership has grown from a mere 4 people at the first meeting to 
                                over 130 members on the C.A.R.S. mailing list and keeps growing! 
                                Other events included hosting concerts like the Flower Kings on March 11, 2006 
                                and again on October 19, 2006 and helping spread the word about 
                                local concerts (Porcupine Tree & Marillion) and holding our 
                                annual "Colorado Prog Jam" which was first held on April 26, 2003 
                                where the musical members of our group get a chance to play 
                                "all of the Prog Songs they ever wanted to play in a band but were afraid to ask". 
                                On March 27, 2023, C.A.R.S. celebrated their 23rd year and things are 
                                looking great for the future! 
                                Prog On!
